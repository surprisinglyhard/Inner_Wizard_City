//World Name?//

  >The world should mainly be a classic DnD setting with everyone being dirt poor d4 regular humans but the wizard city 
  that this story takes place in should be lightyears moroe advanced looking more like a Magic Dystopia instead of Cyberpunk
  
  This city is heavily enchanted and hidden form the world of the regular humans and their troubles due to the fact it would "literally" blow their minds
